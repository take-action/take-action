Campaigns 
Walk for Freedom- a global fundraising & awareness event. Show up locally, will impact globally. Walk for Freedom is a global fundraising and awareness event. Rallying thousands of abolitionists, taking millions of steps, showing up in hundreds of cities all over the world, Walk for Freedom is an outward expression of our inward desire to see slavery completely abolished. On October 20, 2018 in communities around the world, you’ll see us–21st century abolitionists–walking in single-file lines wearing black with a message that can't be ignored: slavery still exists.
Can you see me 
It’s a public awareness campaign with the ultimate purpose of reaching more victims and arresting more traffickers. Our goal is to turn awareness into action by equipping people to report tips to national hotlines when they suspect trafficking, so that victims are identified and assisted.
